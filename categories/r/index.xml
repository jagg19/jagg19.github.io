      <description>Using Airbnb By now, most Gen Z and millenials have heard of or used Airbnb for a range of many reasons such as looking for a place to crash or taking a vacation. I believe what won the consumer’s attention over hotel’s was the fact that you are getting the “homey” setting and privacy while away on vacation instead of a hotel enviroment. I realized not everyone want’s to part ways with room service, benefits of a having a full-service bar in the lobby, pool &amp;amp; spa’s, sometimes a gym, and the 100+ channels that comes with almost all hotel’s but when comparing the prices and the extra sq footage, it is hard not to take a look at and possibly book Airbnb listings.</description>

      <description>Does it work? Seems like it does. This is my first blog post! I wanted to create my own blog using R programming, R Studio, Git, and Github where I would host my personal site and opinions. These opinions will not be fabricated and will be based off my personal own analysis.
Why start a blog? I have a huge passion for analyzing financial data, especially those 10-K’s and 10-Q’s!</description>
