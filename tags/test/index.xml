      <description>Does it work? Seems like it does. This is my first blog post! I wanted to create my own blog using R programming, R Studio, Git, and Github where I would host my personal site and opinions. These opinions will not be fabricated and will be based off analysis.
Why start a blog? I have a huge passion for analyzing financial data, especially those 10-K’s and 10-Q’s!! To most, it is just a 75+ page document full of financial jargon and data.</description>
